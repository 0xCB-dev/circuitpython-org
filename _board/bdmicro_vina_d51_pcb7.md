**Everything you need from your Control Module**

* **POWER** : Powerful 32-bit ARM Cortex M4 microcontroller @ 120 MHz,
    based on the Microchip ATSAMD51N20 w/1MB of program flash and 256K
    of RAM

* **INDUSTRIAL GRADE** : All industrial spec parts and Latch-Lock
    connectors for reliable operation in demanding applications

* **CONNECTIVITY** : USB interface for connecting to your development
    PC or Laptop computer for programming; provides virtual com port
    for CircuitPython console and UART, and mass storage filesystem
    interface to the 64MB on-board QSPI flash for programs and data
    storage; can additionally be used in your application

* **CONTROL & INTERFACING** : RS485, I2C, WIFI & Expansion : Latching
    RS485 interface connector on-board which is a UART-style
    differential bus with high noise immunity common in manufacturing
    and control automation; Latching I2C interface connector on-board
    for sensors, controllers, displays, keypads, etc, on this commonly
    used bus; 12-pin AUX Expansion Socket on-board for expansion
    versatility and WIFI-enabled using the ubiquitous and inexpensive
    ESP-01S module; additionally, VINA-D51 brings out 48 I/O capable
    of Digital I/O, UARTs, I2C, SPI, A/D, DAC, USB, and many other
    useful control and interfacing capabilities to the edge + 10
    additional I/O on the AUX Socket

* **DEVELOPMENT & DEBUG** : CircuitPython and UF2 Bootloader
    pre-installed to get started developing right away with just a
    laptop or PC and a text editor; no extra software or IDEs to
    install and no extra hardware to purchase; and with a standard ARM
    Cortex SWD debug header on-board, low level programming in C/C++
    with source-level, single-step debugging utilizing a hardware
    programmer like the Segger J-Link is easy

* **DATA STORAGE** : Large 64 MB of on-board flash filesystem storage
    space for your programs and data presented as an external drive on
    your development workstation; soldered directly to the board, this
    flash storage will not suffer from corrosion or vibration in harsh
    environments like SD-Card type storage are prone

* **FLEX VOLTAGE** : Robust power section with wide voltage input
    range for flexible and reliable operation, and enough headroom to
    supply power to other devices - perhaps even your whole
    application board - up to about 3 amps; incorporates industrial
    grade Molex Latch-Lock connector that will not vibrate loose even
    in the most demanding applications
