Students/Makers can skip the hassle of constructing the basic electronic circuit which is boring and time-consuming. Although it is equally important to learn about basic electronics, it can always come later after they have experienced how easy it is to create an awesome project. Start with fun and excitement. Start coding right away and see your board lights up and plays the melody with the press of a button.

For experienced makers, this is also useful to quickly test your code without having to connect any other devices.

With the conventional Arduino boards, makers also face another common problem - difficulty in troubleshooting their circuit. This is because when it doesn't work, they do not know whether the problem is due to wire connection or coding.

With Maker UNO, the problem is solved! Not only do the onboard LEDs work as outputs, they can also act as indicators, clearly showing what's happening on that pin. When the pin is used as input, you can clearly see whether the signal is received by just looking at changes on the LEDs.

One of the brilliant features of the official Arduino Uno is the label printed on its pin headers. It saves a lot of time when connecting the I/O pins to the external circuit. So, a set of these label stickers for pin headers is included in each of the Maker UNO! (Please note that you need to peel off the stickers and stick them on your Maker UNO by yourself)
