There are two Serpente boards, they are both virtually the same, except for the USB connector. The standard Serpente board contains a USB Type-C connector, and the Serpente Plug uses the board itself as a Type-A USB plug.

If you are familiar with the Digispark boards, you may notice some similarities. This fact is of course not incidental, the Serpente boards are inspired by the Digispark, both in form-factor as well as use-cases. The Serpente boards are meant to be used as quick and dirty, yet flexible, prototyping tools.
