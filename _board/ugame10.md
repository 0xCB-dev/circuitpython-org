A tiny game console programmable with Python, which lets you easily re-create
the classic titles. Just draw your sprites in 16-color BMP files, generate
sounds as mono WAV files, and write code in CircuitPython, using the Stage
library which gives you graphic primitives such as tiled grids and sprites.
