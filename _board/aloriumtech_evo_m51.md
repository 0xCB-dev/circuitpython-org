The Evo M51 is an FPGA-enhanced Feather compatible compute module from Alorium Technology that features a 32-bit SAMD51 microcontroller along with an Intel MAX 10 FPGA.  

Designed for use as an embeddable system-on-module, all of the standard Feather I/O are also routed to castellated vias along the edge of the board. There are 34 additional castellated digital I/O connected to the FPGA and accessible via the SAMD51.

Most digital I/O connections are routed through the FPGA to and from the primary and castellated I/O.  This provides the opportunity for developers to immediately capture inputs or drive outputs from the FPGA without requiring direct interaction with the SAMD controller.  

Evo M51 will support Alorium Technology-supplied pre-built FPGA images that target specific application use cases.  In addition, designers will have the option to develop their own custom logic blocks and integrate them into the top-level MAX 10 FPGA design.

Evo was specifically designed to support running CircuitPython.  It is also programmable with Arduino just like many other boards based upon the SAMD51.  So, writing and uploading firmware to the microcontroller is easy and familiar.
