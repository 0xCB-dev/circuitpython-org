The "Explorer Badge" is an RP2040 based CircuitPython board with integrated features to provide an *all-in-one* learning device.

The board includes:

- 1.54" ePaper display
- neopixels
- touch sensors
- accelerometer
- IR (receiver and emitter)
- I2C STEMMA-QT
- sound (both PWM and I2S support)

There is also a tutorial series associated with the Explore Badge to get users started with Python and then CircuitPython with the integrated hardware. The badge has been tested with the related CircuitPython Learning Guides.

There will be at least two physical implementations of the Explorer Badge. One will be used at a conference in 2024 (that implementation will have a focus on youth education). The other will be generally available through Tindie and other options.
