VIDI X features a powerful ESP32 processor with dual cores, built-in Wi-Fi and BT, and has a 2.8â€³ touchscreen.

It functions as both a multifunctional microcomputer and a development board. It can also be used as an efficient hub for a variety of different sensors.

The device has an array of basic components like a built-in microphone, speaker, temperature sensor, IR diode, and light sensor. These components are all connected via a DIP switch to ESP32, enabling the user to select which sensors to connect. If a larger number of input/ output pins are required, users can release pins for sensors with a microswitch. This opens up a wealth of possibilities for connection to various input/ output units such as sensors and actuators.

To power up a VIDI X device, you need either 3 x AA batteries (1.5 V or 1.2 V) or a USB cable and a powerbank or another USB-compatible power source.

- Rugged and ready to use, pre-assembled kit. Minimal time is required to start working with students.
- Microcomputer does not require an operating system: no OS maintenance required
- Cross-curricular pathways optimized for your students
- Browser based programming environment: Chromebook, Windows and Mac compatible.
