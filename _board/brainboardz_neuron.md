BrainBoardz is a revolutionary modular Mini PCE Express (mPCIe) based system that greatly simplifies the design of circuit boards and custom microcontroller projects. Anyone can easily develop custom projects to harness the impressive capabilities of the latest generation Espressif ESP32-S3 microcontroller, through the use of our inexpensive ESP32-S3 based Neuron modules and our ever expanding range of BrainBoardz prototyping boards. Simply connect a Neuron module to one of our BrainBoardz, connect a USB cable and you are ready to go. Neurons not only provide complete access to the extensive range of capabilities provided by the cutting edge ESP32-S3, they can also function as standalone modules if required. You are welcome to design/manufacture your own BrainBoardz compatible boards and Neuron compatible module(s). The entire BrainBoardz system is fully documented, open source and 100% license free.

Nuerons and BrainBoardz are provided with a complete set of simplified mounting hardware. It takes seconds to add/remove a Neuron module from a BrainBoardz. If you have access to an 3D printer you can also print as many spare mPCIe mounting parts as you need by using the STL/FreeCAD model files provided in our GitHub repository. This revolutionary mPCIe connector based approach supports ultra-low profile projects and guarantees microcontroller module re-usability. There are no fragile pins to contend with in the BrainBoardz system. We can even provide an e mPCIe stencil to make designing your own boards easy. We fully support Arduino and CircuitPython. Are you ready for a prototyping revolution?
