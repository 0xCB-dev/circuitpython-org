BrainBoardz are a revolutionary modular Mini PCE Express (mPCIe) based system that greatly simplifies circuit board design and the development of custom microcontroller based boards.  Through the use of our inexpensive Neuron modules and ever expanding range of BrainBoardz prototyping boards anyone can easily develop custom projects to harness the impressive capabilities of the latest generation Espressif ESP32-S3 microcontroller. Simply connect a Neuron module to one of our many BrainBoardz, connect a USB cable and you are ready to go. Neurons provide full access to the extensive range of capabilities provided by the cutting edge ESP32-S3, and they can also function as standalone modules if required. 

Neurons can be easily added or removed from a BrainBoardz. The revolutionary mPCIe connector approach supports ultra-low profile projects and guarantees microcontroller module re-usability. There are no fragile pins to contend with in the BrainBoardz system. We fully support Arduino and CircuitPython. Itâ€™s simply Plug and Code. You are welcome to design/manufacture your own BrainBoardz compatible board or Neuron compatible module(s). Nuerons and BrainBoardz are provided with a complete set of mounting hardware. If you have access to an FDM printer you can also print spare parts using the STL model files provided in our GitHub repository.
