A compact 4 channel motor+encoder controller, powered by RP2040. It has RGB and per-motor indicator LEDs plus built in voltage and current sensing. There's also a Qwiic/STEMMA QT connector for adding breakouts!

## Features
- Powered by RP2040 (Dual Arm Cortex M0+ running at up to 133Mhz with 264kB of SRAM)
- 2MB of QSPI flash supporting XiP
- 2 Dual H-Bridge motor drivers (DRV8833)
- 4 JST-SH connectors (6 pin) for attaching motors
- Onboard voltage, current and fault sensing
- Per motor current limiting (0.5A)
- Per motor direction indicator LEDs
- Addressable RGB LED/Neopixel
- Reset and BOOT button (the BOOT button can also be used as a user button)
- USB-C connector for programming and power (3A max)
- Qw/ST (Qwiic/STEMMA QT) connector for breakouts


## About RP2040
Raspberry Pi's RP2040 microcontroller is a dual core ARM Cortex M0+ running at up to 133Mhz. It bundles in 264kB of SRAM, 30 multifunction GPIO pins (including a four channel 12-bit ADC), a heap of standard peripherals (I2C, SPI, UART, PWM, clocks, etc), and USB support.

One very exciting feature of RP2040 is the programmable IOs which allow you to execute custom programs that can manipulate GPIO pins and transfer data between peripherals - they can offload tasks that require high data transfer rates or precise timing that traditionally would have required a lot of heavy lifting from the CPU.
