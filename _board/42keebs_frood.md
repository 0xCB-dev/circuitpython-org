The Frood is a high-performance and affordable Pro Micro drop-in replacement based on a Raspberry Pi RP2040. It is physically and electrically compatible with Elite-C/nice!nano as much as possible.

It follows the SparkFun Pro Micro RP2040 pinout with 5 more pins (GPIO12-GPIO16) added along the bottom edge (like on Elite-C), and USB data lines broken out in the top corners (like nice!nano).

## Features
- Pinout compatible with the classic Pro Micro
- I/O pin mapping follows Sparkfun Pro Micro RP2040 with 5 more digital I/O pins at the bottom (same layout as the Elite-C)
- Powerful dual-core RP2040 32-bit Arm microcontroller with 133 MHz clock speed (8 times the Pro Micro)
- 2 MB flash storage – *64 times* as much as Pro Micro! Should fit all the RGB animations in the world!
- 256 kB SRAM, or 10 times as much as Pro Micro
- Just 3.3 mm thick thanks to a mid-mount USB-C socket that sits flush with the bottom of the PCB
- UF2 bootloader for drag & drop flashing – the bootloader presents a USB flash-like device. No extra software needed!
- Total of 23 digital I/O pins supporting a maximum of 132 switches in a standard 11×12 matrix! Or perhaps a 40% split keyboard (up to 46 switches) with no diodes?
- 4 pins configurable as analogue input (ADC)
- USB data lines (D+, D-) broken out at the top for daughterboard/external USB-C socket compatibility
- 500 mA on-board 3.3 V regulator
- 500 mA resettable fuse for over-current protection
- USB power (VBUS) connected to digital I/O pin GPIO19 for USB power detection (for split keyboard main half detection)
- Currently available in black with immersion gold finish (ENIG). White version coming soon!
