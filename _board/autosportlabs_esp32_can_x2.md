The Autosport Labs ESP32-CAN-X2 is a development board suitable for automotive, industrial, and aerospace applications.

It features the ESP32-S3-WROOM-1-N8R8 using an XtensaÂ® 32-bit LX7 CPU operating at up to 240 MHz (8MB flash, 8MB PSRAM), dual CAN bus support, two CAN bus transceivers, and an automotive-grade power supply to safely integrate it into your car project.

All IO pins are broken out to a breadboard-friendly layout so you can easily integrate it into bigger projects. A separate connector also allows power, ground, and dual CAN connections so you can quickly wire it into a CAN network.

Use the two CAN bus networks for extra versatility - some ideas:
  - Bridge two CAN bus networks with different baud rates
  - Collect data from two different CAN bus networks with different baud rates
  - Isolate traffic between CAN networks
  - Create a "man in the middle" agent, which will help identify the source of CAN messages, helpful for CAN bus reverse-engineering efforts

**Components:**

- **ESP32-S3-WROOM-1-N8R8** microcontroller powerful dual-core Xtensa LX6 CPU running at up to 240 MHz.
- **Automotive grade power supply**: Ruggedized power supply up to 40v input, provides safety for automotive applications where damaging voltage surges and load dumps are common.
- **Pin Headers**: All available GPIO pins are broken out to the pin headers on the board for easy interfacing and programming. For details, please see [our documentation](https://wiki.autosportlabs.com/ESP32-CAN-X2).
- **USB-C port**: A USB-C port supplies power for programming, flashing your code, for communications using the USB 1.1 specification, as well as for JTAG debugging.
- **Boot Button**: Download button. Holding down **Boot** and then pressing **Reset** initiates Firmware Download mode for downloading firmware through the serial port.
- **Reset Button**: Resets the device
- **LED**: User controllable LED; use it to indicate status or anything else you would like.
- **Power LED**: Turns on when power is connected to the board.
- **Power / CAN headers**: 6 pin JST-PH header provides 12v (nominal) power, ground, CAN1 and CAN2 connections.
- **CAN termination jumpers**: 2 CAN termination jumpers are provided, default enabled with 120 ohm termination
- **Built-in CAN transceivers**: Dual CAN transceivers are included on board. 
- **2nd CAN bus provided by MCP2515**: while CAN1 uses the built in TWAI CAN compatible controller; CAN2 uses the on-board MCP2515 CAN bus controller.
